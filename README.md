# svba

svba is a web-based interface to keep track of StockStram. You can find the main
svba instance [here](https://svba.null.ist). It runs in flask and your wsgi
implementation of choice.

To keep the data updated, you'll have to set up cron jobs that run `gen_data.py`
every five minutes and `gen_digest.py` every 30 minutes. These intervals can,
of course, be changed.

Enabling gzip compression (and caching of compressed files) in your server is
highly recommendedâ€”data file sizes reduced by up to 90% are noticable at
compression level 9.
